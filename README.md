# My Cloud & AI Experience Summary
This work summarizes my extensive cloud-scale software development as well as recent Artificial Intelligence experience while working for a startup. My software development experience spans over 25+ years of successful technology leadership experience as technology visionary, board member & evangelist with proven ability to be a catalyst for creating technology vision and strategy. My experience comes from while working for leading product companies as well as cloud & software innovation lab. environment.

All these years, I have been involved in the strategic planning and execution of technology initiatives related to cloud/distributed computing & AI/ML infrastructure, including a wide range of technologies such as compute, networking, storage and computer architecture.

The “Artificial Intelligence (AI)” link, on the other hand, covers my perspective on various aspects of ongoing AI related technology & trends based on the extensive research/strategy work I recently did for a start-up AI company.
