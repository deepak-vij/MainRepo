# My Cloud & AI Experience Summary
This work summarizes my extensive cloud-scale software development as well as recent Artificial Intelligence experience while working for a startup. My software development experience spans over 25+ years of successful technology leadership experience as technology visionary, board member & evangelist with proven ability to be a catalyst for creating technology vision and strategy. My experience comes from while working for leading product companies as well as cloud & software innovation lab. environment.

All these years, I have been involved in the strategic planning and execution of technology initiatives related to cloud/distributed computing & AI/ML infrastructure, including a wide range of technologies such as compute, networking, storage and computer architecture.

The following links cover a summary of cloud-scale software platform development from architectural/design perspective. To go along with that, I have captured a summary of programming level design principles/patterns (including sample code).

The “AI” link, on the other hand, covers my perspective on various aspects of ongoing AI related technology & trends.
